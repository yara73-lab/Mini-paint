Mini Paint Program 🎨🖌️
A simple Java-based painting application that allows users to create, modify, and manage geometric shapes using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Swing.

Features 🚀
✅ Shape Creation – Draw circles, rectangles, squares, and line segments using a simple interface.
✅ Shape Manipulation – Move and resize shapes dynamically.
✅ Save & Load – Store and retrieve shapes from a file for persistence.
✅ User-Friendly GUI – Select and modify shapes via buttons and dropdown menus.
✅ Object-Oriented Design – Implements OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism.

Technologies Used 🔧
Java (Swing for GUI, Object-Oriented Programming)
File Handling (for saving and loading shapes)
How It Works? 🛠
1️⃣ Select a shape using buttons.
2️⃣ Enter properties (position, radius, length, etc.) via a dialog box.
3️⃣ Modify shapes – Move or resize using the GUI.
4️⃣ Save and load shapes for future use.

This project demonstrates GUI development, OOP concepts, and event-driven programming in Java. 🚀
